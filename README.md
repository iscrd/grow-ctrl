# What is grow-ctrl?

grow-ctrl, developed by OASIS, is an open toolkit for controlled environment culturing, remote monitoring, and data collection. It is maintained with the goal of making the capabilities of automated gardening, precision agriculture, and cell culturing available to everyone. All functions can be accomplished with a RaspberryPi + Arduino and the requisite peripheral hardware. The software interfaces a sensor array, camera, and appliance set and is controllable via shell or mobile app (currently in Beta).      
# Hardware Setup

DIYers can purchase a complete PCB (currently in Beta) to get a jump on wiring or instead follow the prototype wiring diagram available here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQgn0rGJVujcdRgQUK21jd7PybuvJZdb9DuSV6mf8QKvGKiNE8npMvLlrqJvNgFDA/pubhtml

# Software Setup (Raspberry Pi) Raspberry Pi OS Lite

First, flash Raspian to an SD card, insert it into the board, and plug in the power
(NOTE: the SD card is what is used as the memory of your pi and will hold program code and boot instructions. Using a higher quality one and shutting down the pi properly  will increase the stability of Oasis) 
  
  1. Download Balena Etcher: https://www.balena.io/etcher/
  
  2. Download the latest Raspberry Pi Operating System: https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/operating-systems/
  
  3. Connect a micro-SD card to your personal computer
 
  4. Open up balena etcher, follow onscreen instructions to flash the RasPi OS to the SD, will eject automatically when finished
  
  5. Place the SD card into the front slot of the Raspberry Pi
  
  6. Connect a keyboard and monitor to the board via USB
  
  7. Login: Username: pi Password: raspberry
  
  7. Power up, and follow the on-screen setup guide
     - select languages & timezone
     - connect WiFi
     - update software

Now we will install the grow-ctrl software and configure the pi to run it. This is where we will start working from the terminal, so open up a new window.

1. Remove unnecessary software
   - Raspbian comes with a package called ‘GVfs’ (GNOME virtual file system). It does not do much and causes a lot of kernel panics (crashes)

         sudo apt-get purge --auto-remove gvfs-backends gvfs-fuse

2. Clone the grow-ctrl repository

       cd ~
       git clone https://github.com/OasisRegenerative/grow-ctrl.git
       cd grow-ctrl

3. Install dependencies & change settings
       
       pip3 install subprocess32 firebase pyrebase python_jwt gcloud sseclient requests-toolbelt pickle5
       sudo raspi-config
       - Interface
          - Enable camera

3. Setup launcher and listener script (This is only required if you intend to launch the program at startup, in conjunction with the mobile interface)

       cd grow-ctrl
       chmod 775 launcher.sh
       cd # return home
       mkdir logs
       nano ~/logs/growCtrl_log.json 

    - Use cron to make the launcher and listener scripts initialize at reboot.

          sudo crontab -e
      - Add the following lines to this file, then exit by hitting ctrl+x, Y, enter

            @reboot sh /home/pi/grow-ctrl/launcher.sh >/home/pi/logs/cronlog_launcher 2>&1
            @reboot sh /home/pi/grow-ctrl/listener.sh >/home/pi/logs/cronlog_listener 2>&1
  
     - To launch, test, and debug the startup script, run:

           sudo reboot
           cd logs
           cat cronlog_launcher
           cat cronlog_listener
           cat growCtrl_log.json

4. If you plan on connecting to a mobile or desktop interface to remotely monitor your grow, follow these steps to set up access point networking. This will allow user and network credentials to be passed from your device to the grow-ctrl node
   - Tip: Make a backup of config files with “sudo cp”

          sudo cp /etc/network/interfaces /etc/network/interfaces-backup

  - Tip If you had previous config files and made a backup you can restore your original with the command “sudo mv”:

          sudo mv /etc/network/interfaces-backup /etc/network/interfaces

  - Set up access-point:

        sudo apt install hostapd
        sudo systemctl unmask hostapd
        sudo systemctl enable hostapd
        sudo apt install dnsmasq
        sudo DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt install -y netfilter-persistent iptables-persistent
        sudo cp /etc/dhcpcd.conf /etc/dhcpcd_backup.conf
        sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf 

       - Go to the end of the file and   add the following:
       
             interface wlan0
             static ip_address=192.168.4.1/24
             nohook wpa_supplicant

        sudo mv /etc/dnsmasq.conf /etc/dnsmasq_backup.conf
        sudo nano /etc/dnsmasq.conf
       - Add the following to the file and save it:

             # Listening interface
             interface=wlan0 
             # Pool of IP addresses served via DHCP
             dhcp-range=192.168.4.2,192.168.4.20,255.255.255.0,24h
             # Local wireless DNS domain
             domain=wlan     
             # Alias for this router
             address=/gw.wlan/192.168.4.1
    
        sudo rfkill unblock wlan
        sudo nano /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf
       - Add the information below to the configuration file. This configuration assumes we are using channel 7, with a network name of NameOfNetwork, 
       and a password AardvarkBadgerHedgehog. Note that the name and password should not have quotes around them. 
       The passphrase should be between 8 and 64 characters in length.
          country_code=GB
          interface=wlan0
          ssid=NameOfNetwork
          hw_mode=g
          channel=7
          macaddr_acl=0
          auth_algs=1
          ignore_broadcast_ssid=0
          wpa=2
          wpa_passphrase=AardvarkBadgerHedgehog
          wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
          wpa_pairwise=TKIP
          rsn_pairwise=CCMP
       - Note the line country_code=GB: it configures the computer to use the correct wireless frequencies in the United Kingdom. 
       Adapt this line and specify the two-letter ISO code of your country. See Wikipedia for a list of two-letter ISO 3166-1 country codes.

       To use the 5 GHz band, you can change the operations mode from hw_mode=g to hw_mode=a. Possible values for hw_mode are:
       a = IEEE 802.11a (5 GHz)
       b = IEEE 802.11b (2.4 GHz)
       g = IEEE 802.11g (2.4 GHz)
       ad = IEEE 802.11ad (60 GHz)
      
       - For these changes to take effect, run: 
       
             sudo systemctl reboot

  
      - Access point should be discoverable on development machine. Test connection with

             ssh pi@192.168.4.1

      - Stage config files for network mode switching
    
            sudo cp /etc/dhcpcd.conf /etc/dhcpcd_AP.conf
            sudo cp /etc/dhcpcd_backup.conf /etc/dhcpcd_WiFi.conf
            sudo cp /etc/dnsmasq.conf /etc/dnsmasq_AP.conf
            sudo cp /etc/dnsmasq_backup.conf /etc/dnsmasq_WiFi.conf
  
      - Note: Series of Commands to Launch in Access Point Mode
    
            sudo cp /etc/dhcpcd_AP.conf /etc/dhcpcd.conf
            sudo cp /etc/dnnanosmasq_AP.conf /etc/dnsmasq.conf
            sudo systemctl enable hostapd
            sudo systemctl reboot
  
      - Note: Series of Commands to Launch in Wifi Mode

            sudo cp /etc/dhcpcd_WiFi.conf /etc/dhcpcd.conf
            sudo cp /etc/dnsmasq_WiFi.conf /etc/dnsmasq.conf
            sudo systemctl disable hostapd
            sudo systemctl reboot

5. Finally, we copy our configuration files into the root directory where they can be accessed by our programs

            cd grow-ctrl
            cp hardware_config_default_template.json /home/pi/hardware_config.json
            cp access_config_default_template.json /home/pi/access_config.json
            cp device_state_default.json /home/pi/device_state.json
            cp device_state_default.json /home/pi/device_state_buffer.json
            cp grow_params_default_template.json /home/pi/grow_params.json
            cp grow_params_default_template.json /home/pi/grow_params_buffer.json
            cp growCtrl_log_default.json /home/pi/logs/growCtrl_log.json


#Software Setup (Arduino):
  
1. Download the official arduino IDE for your preferred operating system. We recommend doing this on Mac or PC and not on the Raspberry Pi itself

2. Plug the arduino into your computer via USB

3. Download the .ino sketch from this Github, install libraries using the Arduino IDE

4. Verify and load the sketch onto the board

5. Find the serial port on raspberry pi

6. Plug in arduino to pi via usb

7. Open terminal, run:

       ls /dev/tty*

      - You should see the port which the arduino is plugged into. To determine which port it actuallyis, unplug the arduino and run the command again to see which ones appear and disappear
      - Copy the serial port ID in quotes to the python scripts (in this case, controller.py, oasis_server.py, grow_ctrl.py) -> serial.Serial(‘your port’,9600) 

#Start Grow Cycle from the Command Line:
  - The latest grow-cycle program (which keeps the environment steady, does actions on timers, and collects data) is titled "grow_ctrl.py"
  - To run it, open the terminal:
    
        cd ~/grow-ctrl
        sudo python3 grow_ctrl.py main

  - when running from the command line, we can edit the parameters used by the grow manager (temperature, humidity, etc.) by modifying the corresponding fields in grow_params.json [more detailed description coming soon]
